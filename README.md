# **STOCK ANALYSIS REFACTORED**

## **Overview of Project:**
This projects attempts to refactor VBA code to loop through all the data in one time in order to collect all the data of the Stock Market Dataset and determine whether or not the refactored code ran faster.

## **Results:**

After running both the practice codes and the refactored codes 50 times, it was found that the refactored codes ran a bit more faster than the original codes.
